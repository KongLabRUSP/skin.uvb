* Added Venn diagrams within each timepoint and within each comparison    

From Dr. Kong:    
I discussed the RNA-seq data for UVB and UA and SFN study yesterday with Anne and Ran, so, here is what I like to see in the ms:    
1. Control no UVB   
2. Control with UVB    
3. UVB + UA    
4. UVB + SFN    
So, split the study into 2 ms - UVB+UA and UVB+SFN    
For UVB+UA - compare 4 sets separately and NOT at the same time:  
1. 2 wk vs 15 wks - initiation/promotion stage    
2. 15 wks vs 25 wks - progression stage    
3. 2 wk vs 25 wks - all the way to end stage - very high risk skin BUT no tumor    
4. 2 wks vs tumor - all the way to tumor   
Do all at the same time - BUT not sure what we get out of this?    
Repeat for UVB+SFN.

* Added Venn diagrams    
    
From Anne:   
For the venn2, could you specify the comparison between two groups, like (1) UVB vs Control (No UVB), (2) UVA+UA vs UVB, and (3) UVB+SFN vs UVB? So we need these three venn graphics similar to Venn2 with still four time-points each. Also, it's will be great if you can send me an excel file of shared genes with changes (value 1, value 2, log2 fold change, q value) at different time points.
